# Prediction of demand for shared bikes using Multiple Linear Regression

> A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## General Information

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing company, has seen a drop in revenue due to the COVID19 pandemic. To recover, they want to understand the future demand for shared bikes once the lockdown ends. This will help them create a business plan to meet customer needs and outperform competitors.

Specifically the company wants to know:

1) Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes?
2) How well those variables describe the bike demands?

The solution to this problem is divided into following sections:

- Data loading and Understanding
- Data Preprocessing
- Data Visualization and EDA
- Data preparation
- Model Building
- Prediction 
- Evaluation

## Technologies Used
Python Libraries:
- Pandas,numpy(Data Preprocessing)
- Matplotlib, seaborn(Data Visualization)
- Scikit-Learn, statsmodels.api(Model building)
- Scikit-Learn(Model Evaluation)

## Conclusions
The demand for bike sharing is impacted by several variables. Over time, it usually rises, particularly on workdays and during warmer months. 
Bike usage increases in the summer and, oddly enough, even throughout the winter. Demand is lowest in windy, foggy, or wet circumstances, while it is highest in September and on Saturdays.
